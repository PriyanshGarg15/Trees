In Java, primitive types such as int, float, boolean, etc., cannot hold null values. This is because primitives are not objects 
and therefore do not have the ability to represent the absence of a value. Here are more detailed reasons:

Primitive Types vs. Reference Types

Primitive Types:
Represent raw values directly.
Cannot be null because they are not objects; they are stored directly in memory.
Examples include int, char, double, etc.

Reference Types:
Represent references (or pointers) to objects.
Can be null, indicating that the reference does not point to any object.
Examples include classes, arrays of objects, and interfaces, such as Integer, String, Object[], etC.
